The purpose of this program is to ask for the user to sign up for Programmer's Toolkit Monthly Subscription Box and have
them select their level of membership and print out their selection and the cost.

"""


"""
Each month is something different, t-shirts, stickers, figurines, even programming books!
The levels are the following:

    Platinum
    Gold
    Silver
    Bronze
    Free Trial

Platinum is $60, each level below is 10 dollars cheaper, and the free trial is free. Write a program that uses a
selection statement, getting user's input for a level and printing the cost for that level.
Submit your .py file.
As an example, after it describes the Subscription box levels, it then says "which level would you like to try?" if I
enter "silver" or something equating to level silver - it should say something like "Silver is $40 a month. Thanks for
selecting that"
